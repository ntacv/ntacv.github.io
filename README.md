# ntacv.github.io
Main website for testing and production on [ntacv](https://ntacv.github.io)

idea: each section of different theme (code, photo, vlog, links) has a special design, from modern to geek to funny
sections follows: "i a little bit of..." developer, designer, photographer...
each word inline, works as a menu that display the page below the text. 

"From vanilla to exotic" languages
